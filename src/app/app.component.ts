// SOLUTIONS:
// I have carefully read and understand the job requirements and here are the proposed solutions i came up with sir,
// - using ASP.NET CORE MVC ensures seemless integration of components and smooth navigation for our visitors.
// - Speaking of Navigation: A navigation bar will be at the top of each page which will offer easy access to the homepage and other sections of your site, just like this site i created: https://paulrichard.vercel.app/.
// - The site will be organized into logical sections professional and personal information or dedicated pages for your hobbies so visitors can find conetent they are most interested, We'll choose a unique Bootstrap theme from Bootswatch to maintain consistency across the pages.
// - we will remember to include link to resume(pdf format) and host the website on Azure, for reliable performance and accessibility.

// In summary, we'll create a visually stunning and user-friendly website that showcases your personality and achievements. With clear navigation, engaging content, and reliable hosting on Azure, your website will effectively represent you to the world.
